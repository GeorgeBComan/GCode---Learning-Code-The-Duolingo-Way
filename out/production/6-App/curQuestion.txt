Write a Java program that converts the number of inches to meters.<br/><br/>The inch is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to ​1/36 yard but usually understood as ​1/12 of a foot.<br/><br/>The meter is the base unit of length in some metric systems, including the International System of Units (SI). The SI unit symbol is m.<br/><br/>Note: One inch is 0.0254 meter.<br/>Output: Print the number of meters<br/>The number has to be a double, since printing an int would round the number of meters and the conversion<br/>would be inaccurate.<br/>
