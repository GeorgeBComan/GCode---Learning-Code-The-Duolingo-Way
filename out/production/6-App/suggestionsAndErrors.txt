errr---Math.a:This is how you use the Math absolute:

Math.abs(firstInt - secondInt);

This will print the difference between firstInt and secondInt, and it will be always positive.
This is also called the difference.

Example:
Math.abs(1 - 3);  // => Math.abs(-2);

Outputs:
2

errr---int   :This is how you declare an int variable:

int a;

int a = 0;  // sets the value of a to 0

int a;

int a = 0;  // sets the value of a to 0
sugg---if    :if - In programming, it's often desirable to execute a certain section of code based upon whether the specified condition is true or false.
For this, we use 'if statements'.
This is how an if looks like:
if (number > 0) {
	System.out.println("Number is positive.");
}
else{
	System.out.println("Number is negative.");
}
sugg---for   :"for loop" provides a concise way of writing the loop structure.
Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line.
Thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
This is how you write a for loop:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.print(i);
}
Outputs:01234
sugg---System:System - The basic output statement in Java is   System.out.println ( );  
System.out.println(" text " ); will print what is between the double quotes “ “ and move the printing cursor to the next line.
System.out.print ( “ text ”); will print what is between the double quotes and leave the printing cursor on the same line.
sugg---while :while - A while loop statement in Java programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
When executing, if the boolean_expression result is true, then the actions inside the loop will be executed.
int count = 1;
while (count < 4) {
	System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
        count++;
}
Outputs:
1
2

errr---System:System - Here is how a print statement looks like 
System.out.println("text");
Make sure you don't forgive to close the quotes
It can also be used to print variables like this:
System.out.println(var);
